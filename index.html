    <h2><div></div>2014: The Next Frontier</h2></div>
    
    <p>This year brings a lot of hope to the franchise.  After a brief discussion in changing the Franchise Name (Originally the Canadians: 
    But there was a lot of pressure from congress to change the name).  We decided to stick with the name.</div>

    <h2>The Draft</h2>
    <div></div>
    <p>Holding the #5 pick overall.  The Red Army decided to go back to their roots by drafting a top notch quaterback.  Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers were a coin flip.  Drew Brees playing a dome and staying healthy  While Aaron Rodgers being a little younger and more of a wild card.
    After RG3 selected Drew Brees (Andrew Luck will play eventually), the Red Army's decision was easy.  Aaron Rodgers.
    The goal for the second round was to select one of the top receivers like Antonio Brown, Julio Jones, or AJ Green.  After they were taken and Sleeping with the Fishes selected Bishop Sankey.  It was down to DeMarco Murray and Marshawn Lynch.  Murray was picked and a borderline first round pick wound up on the Army.
    that it was all question marks.  Keeping 3 WR's, I wanted to add a steady 4th to the team and I selected Victor Cruz.  
    After selecting Jason Witten as a tightend.  I selected lottery picks the rest of the way, with the goal that one or two may turn into gold.
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
  <p>Had all the makings to be great.  After an opening night gem from Marshawn Lynch and a dud from Aaron Rodgers.  The Army was still in good shape to start 1-0 for the first time since 2005.  After 2 stellar performances from Leveon Bell and Coradelle Patterson.  We were ready to coast to victory.
  Not so fast.  After a dud from Jason Witten (counteracted Dez Bryant's weak game) and some sub par games by Flounder's Doug Martin, TB Defense, and
  an average game from Monte Ball.  The stage was set.  Only 14 pts away with Victor Cruz and Cardinals defense.  Like previous fortune of the Red Army they both laid a goose egg and combined for 8 pts.
